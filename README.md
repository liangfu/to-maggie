## Preface

This would be a serie of letters to you, which I hope you would read some day when you grow up.
I intended to make this available online, so that I can keep on tracking what I have written
and share some of my thoughts to the public. Hope you wouldn't mind.

## First Letter

Cheerfully, your mommy gave birth to you when on Apirl 8th, 2016.
The date is choosen by your mom, hoping it would be a lucky birthday.
And after your birth, you are healthy and growing quickly one day after another.

The city where you born, is named Shanghai, that's where our house is located.
But daddy doesn't work there, the city where daddy worked is named Beijing.
It's a bit far away from home, around 1,500 kilometers.Â 
To see you, daddy have to spend 5 hours taking fastest train in China from where he worked.

[//]: # (Your daddy, it's me, who is writing this letter to you, is a software engineer.)
